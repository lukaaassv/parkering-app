# Local parking app
This app was made to help the user to quickly know which side to park their car on and for how long. The need for this app came from a local municipality implementing new parking rules, which were rather confusing, especially for elder people or people in a hurry. With a simplistic UI and a countdown, users can know which side is allowed to park on instantly, instead of having to figure out the rules from the signs.
